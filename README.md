# Sierra Negra volcano, Ecuador - Topography

This is a topography point cloud of the 2018 lava flows of the Sierra Negra
volcano, located on the GalÃ¡pagos islands, Ecuador.
The data are generated using structure from motion (SFM) and shows nice
topographic features and different roughness of the lava flows.
Good to show examples of calculating slope and other terrain properties from
the point cloud or gridded data.

## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

* Data were cropped to smaller region to align with previously published
  studies of the data and make file sizes under 10 Mb.
* Coordinates converted from UTM to WGS84 geographic.
* Export to a compressed CSV for easier loading with Pandas.

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
